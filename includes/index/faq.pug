    +entry("I cannot code. Can I attend anyway?"): p.
        Sure, you should definitely attend! Whether you have written lots of code or just have a creative soul,
        this hackathon needs you! In true hackathon spirit all students are very friendly and willing to
        help each other out.
    +entry("Seriously, is it free?!"): p.
        Yes, we’re not kidding you. Thanks to our sponsors we will provide free food, swag, snacks and drinks 
        at the hackathon. Plus, there will be mentors, workshops and judges only for
        the sake of YOU.

    +title("Hacking!")
    +entry("Can I build on my hack before the event?"): p.
        No. That's not fair. You can come up with ideas, but not build them. You are of course allowed to use
        libraries, frameworks and templates for your hacks.
    +entry("What do people usually build?"): p.
        AUHack has been home to a wide variety of projects, from amazing hardware projects to the coolest VR
        Games and the most useful services and apps.
    +entry("What hardware will be available to hack on?"): p.
        We always have a wide spectrum of hardware available, provided by the different labs at Aarhus University, 
        as well as by our sponsors. A detailed list will be available as we get closer to the event!
    +entry("How do I get the hardware?"): p.
        This has not currently been decided for this year's AUHack.
    //-
        We have the pleasure of being able to use all of the hardware from #[a(href='https://www.chomskylab.dk/' target='_blank') chomskylab.dk]!
        The way this works is: 
        #[br]
        1. You make an account on the website (in the "AU-ID" field put EXTXXXXXX where the Xs are random numbers if 
        you are not from here), 
        #[br]
        2. Browse the website and find the hardware that you want to use, 
        #[br]
        3. Go to the nice LabTools people near the info stand and tell them the hardware that you would like to use, 
        #[br]
        4. Wait a bit while they go and get the hardware, and
        #[br]
        5. Use the hardware for your awesome hack!
        #[br]
        You will most likely also need some wires and such - just ask for those as well.
        #[br]#[br]
        When hacking ends you will have to take everything apart again and return it to the LabTools people. See
        the schedule for when you have to do this.

    +title("Application")
    +entry("Do I need to have a team?"): p.
        No. You are more than welcome to make a team before the hackathon, but loads of people come without a
        team. We will help everyone find a team Friday night. We allow groups of 3-5 persons, but recommend
        groups of 4.

    +entry("Can I attend?"): p.
        You might think that a hackathon is for programmers only, but that’s not true. Technology and code is
        one thing – creative minds, bright insights and strategic eyes are another. So, as long as you are
        a student above 18 years old, you are more than welcome. Actually, we believe that the more different 
        people we are, the better.

    +title("Logistics")
    +entry("What do I need to bring?"): p.
        A laptop, cellphone and chargers, as well as a well-rested mind. 
        If you want to hack on hardware, you might need to bring it yourself. What you won't
        need to bring is a pre-determined team, an idea for a hack, nor food and drinks. Also, 
        there is absolutely no reason to bring a bad mood.
