        +entry("What is a hackaton?")
            p.
                A hackathon is an event where people within the IT-world, often students, meet and
                collaborate with each other to develop prototypes or IT-concepts. The purpose of a
                hackathon is rarely to produce finished products, but rather to create ideas and
                “hacks”.
            p.
                A hackathon has nothing to do with the evil-intended “hacking” where bank systems or
                other digital solutions are penetrated and exposed. Instead participants hack
                technology together to develop prototypes of digital solutions.
            p.
                A hackathon gathers people from many interdisciplinary groups and let them compete to
                create the best concept and prototype, typically within 48 hours.
        +entry("Who participates in AUHack?")
            p.
                AUHack is for students from all around the world. Most of the participants are
                students from Aarhus University who study Computer Science, IT Product Development,
                Digital Design, Information Studies, or Engineering.
            p.
                The students that participate in these hackathons are often ambitious and passionate
                about both IT and their studies. They clear their schedule for three days to spend
                an entire weekend, some even refrain from sleeping for two nights in a row, in order
                to develop the best concepts and prototypes.
            p.
                In our experience, it is typically top students that find the time to participate in
                these events. This will be the fourth year in a row that AUHack is held, and over
                200 students from 10 nations participated in 2018.
        +entry("What's in it for me, as a sponsor of AUHack?")
            p.
                AUHack is the perfect opportunity for you to spread the word about your organization
                to some of the brightest IT students in Aarhus and beyond. Depending on which
                sponsor pack you choose, you have the following options:
            ul
                li: p Show your organization logo on all relevant AUHack PR material.
                li: p.
                    Tell the participants about your organization through events and workshops held 
                    exclusively for them.
                li: p.
                    A unique opportunity to see students committed to solve problems and recruit
                    them based on what you see.
                li: p.
                    Represent your organization with mentors that help the participants to solve
                    their problems, creating unique relations between your organization and the
                    bright students.
                li: p.
                    Challenge the participants through design cases or encourage them to use your
                    technology or an API of your choosing. At the end of the weekend, you decide who
                    had the best go at your challenge and reward them with prizes of your choosing.

            ul
                li: p.
                    Get in touch with us on our mail
                    #[a(href=`mailto:sponsor@auhack.org?subject=Sponsor AUHack ${YEAR}`) sponsor@auhack.org],
                    tell how you want to contribute and which sponsor pack you choose. We are
                    flexible, so if you want to contribute with anything that is not listed in the
                    sponsor packs, we’ll be happy to hear from you.
                li: p.
                    Should you choose one of the major sponsor packs, we suggest you find one or
                    more employees from your organization who would want to participate in the
                    weekend, either to host a workshop or an event, or to mentor the students who
                    take on your case.
                li: p Pay the agreed upon fee via a bank transfer.
        +entry("How are my contribution spent?")
            p.
                Your contribution is spent directly on making the event better for the participants.
                The contributions mainly go into:
            ul
                li: p Meals, snacks and drinks for 250 participants Friday to Sunday
                li: p Goodie bags for the participants
                li: p Buying prototyping gear which the participants can use throughout the event.
                li: p Renting rooms and spaces at Aarhus University.
            p.
                All organizers are volunteers, and your contribution will not be spent on salary of
                any kind. The event is non-profit.
        +entry("I want to sponsor a specific event throughout the weekend. Is this possible?")
            p.
                You can choose to be a sponsor on one of the specific events throughout the weekend.
                This means that the event will be organized in your name, as you will be sponsoring
                the expenses for this event. Please do contact us if you have any questions about
                our currently planned events or have an idea for a cool event.
        +entry("Can I be a sponsor, without providing content to the weekend?")
            p.
                If you wish to support the event but do not want to provide content for the weekend,
                you can be a Silver Sponsor . With the Silver Sponsor pack, we will put your company
                logo on the website as well as distribute relevant company material (flyers,
                stickers, etc.) to the participants. Should you wish to contribute with a higher
                amount than Silver or contribute with tools or other gear, please feel free to
                contact us at
