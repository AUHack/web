  h2 Expo
  p.
    After hacking ends all teams will expo their projects. Here judges and fellow
    students will have time to test each other's projects. The expo will be at
    your tables where you have worked throughout the weekend. #[br]
    Each team will be visited once by a pair of judges within a time interval of
    30 minutes. A note will be put on your table around noon to let you know
    when the judges will arive. Thus you will have some time to eat lunch and
    watch other hacks when the judges are not at your table.
