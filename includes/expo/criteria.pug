            h4 Technical Difficulty
            p.
                How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult?
                Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components?
                Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?

            h4 Originality
            p.
                Was the hack unique and interesting? Is it something that has never been seen before?
                This can range from a new spin on a known idea to completely outlandish ideas.

            p.
                Did the hack both look and work beautifully? Have all bugs been squashed?
                The closer it looks and feels to a professional-grade application, the better.

            h4 Usefulness
            p.
                Was the hack useful? Was it intuitive and easy to use?
                Doesn't have to be business-ready, but should have the potential to be
                useful in everyday life.

            h4 Bonus: Learning
            p.
                Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of
                projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality
                projects switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should
                be rewarded.

            h4 Originality
            p.
                The hack or the idea behind it should be unique and interesting. This can range
                from new and crazy spins on known ideas to completely outlandish ideas.

            h4 Funny
            p.
                The hack is obviously a testament to what the human mind can do to make something
                funny, be it a genius pun or something that just makes you laugh.

            h4 Unusefulness
            p.
                The hack doesn't have to be useful or meaningful in any sense.
