# AUHack's Website
Welcome to source code of AUHack's website! 

**As of 2022, Build and Deploy isn't used/doesn't work.**

![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/AUHack/web/workflows/Build%20and%20Deploy/badge.svg?branch=master)

The website is written in Pug and can be compiled as follows:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will output the website to `./build`.

For development purposes, it is easier to use `npm start` which will automatically rebuild the website when a relevant file changes.
