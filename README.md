# AUHack's Website
Welcome to source code of AUHack's website! The website is written in Pug and can be compiled as follows:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will output the website to `./build`.

For development purposes, it is easier to use `npm start` which will automatically rebuild the website when a relevant file changes.
